# Chapter 3 Speech

## 1. Pronunciation is important but obviously not the most important
On April 17, 2009, David Letterman invited a guest, Joe Wong, to his show. You can now find many videos of Joe Wong on Youku by searching for his name. Joe Wong is very thin, wears glasses, and looks dull. However, as soon as he opens his mouth, the audience bursts into laughter with just one sentence. In the next six minutes, one joke after another (American jokes that lose their flavor when translated into Chinese) makes the audience laugh so hard that they almost fall over, and they applaud several times. In the end, even his silence becomes a joke - this is a masterful performance. Joe Wong, born in 1970 in Baishan City, Jilin Province, China, studied chemistry at Jilin University for his undergraduate degree, went to the United States in 1994 to study, and received a PhD in biochemistry from Rice University in 1999.

Joe Wong conquered American audiences with his heavily accented English. This is an incredible thing for most Chinese students who are desperately trying to learn English. Since elementary school, whether it is teachers or students, the mainstream view is that "pronunciation must be standard." Countless teachers are proud and envied for being able to speak "standard" American or British English. Students and teachers often argue about whether they should learn "American" or "British" pronunciation, even turning red in the face.

Chinese students often do not speak English not because they cannot, but mainly because they are afraid. There are many reasons for this, but the most common one is that they are afraid that their pronunciation is not standard. But isn't it normal for second language learners to have imperfect pronunciation? Even for native speakers, it takes a long time to speak clearly. When were you able to express yourself clearly in your native language? Then why should a person be able to express themselves clearly and accurately in a second language from the beginning, and still have "standard pronunciation"?

Try reading the following ten Chinese words. How many can you pronounce correctly?

标识、绯闻、嫉妒、潜力、勾当、慰藉、连累、卑鄙、情不自禁、人才济济

Open your eyes and take a look at the world around us. In fact, the pronunciation of the vast majority of native speakers is not standard. If you don't believe it, you can first examine yourself, and then see how many people around you cannot distinguish between flat tongue and rolled tongue, or between front nasal sound and back nasal sound. Even if you are in Beijing (which is said to be the heart of the country and where the "standard pronunciation" of Mandarin is said to be based on Beijing dialect), you can still hear various accents every day. In our country, what percentage of people can speak standard and pleasant Mandarin? Is it 1%? Go to the Broadcasting and Hosting College and take a look. How much time and effort do those professional hosts (who are undoubtedly native speakers) need to spend to train themselves to reach the standard? China is like this, and foreign countries should not have too much difference in this regard. In English-speaking countries, similarly, less than 1% of people can speak a standard and pleasant specific accent.

All languages ​​in the world are like this, and each language has various accents. English may be the language with the most accents on earth. In the United States, the accents in Southern California and Northern California are already very different, roughly equivalent to the difference between Shandong people and Shanxi people speaking Chinese in China. The pronunciation of New Yorkers and Detroiters is of course also very different. In London, the difference in accents between the east and south is already very obvious. Not to mention "Scottish accent", "Canadian accent", "Australian accent", "New Zealand accent", "Indian accent"...

Paul Meier (paulmeier.com) is a globally renowned phonetics training expert. Many actors who want to make it big in Hollywood ask him for help to eliminate their "non-standard accent" and speak "authentic" American English. His students include (only a small part of them are listed here):

John Ales, Jonathan Brandis, A.J. Buckley, Jewel Kilcher, Jim Caviezel, Simon Baker Denny, Peter Coyote, Stewart Finlay-McLennan, Louise Fletcher, Bill Irwin, Gabrielle Fitzpatrick, Diana Hardcastle, Tom Hulce, Kris Kristofferson, Elizabeth Lackey, Tobey Maguire, Stephen Mailer, Terrence Mann, Callum Keith Rennie, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Kim Myers, Mark Ruffalo, Skeet Ulrich, Celia Weston, David Wenham, Valerie Wildman, Peter Wingfield, Tom Wilkinson, Jeffrey Wright...

On Paul Meier's website, there is a page where various English dialects are demonstrated, including:

Cockney
Hampshire
Irish
Liverpool
Northern Ireland
Scottish
Welsh
Yorkshire; American Southern (Kentucky/Tennessee)
Deep South (Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Mississippi)
Down East New England
General New York
South Boston...

Almost none of them are understandable for students in mainland China who are only used to a certain pronunciation for many years. On this page, you can also find audio samples of multiple dialects. Readers may want to listen carefully. Then, think carefully, is it necessary to have a "standard" pronunciation? Even if there is a need for it, which "standard" should be used?

Obviously, many people disagree with the view that "pronunciation is not that important", but this does not affect the correctness and importance of this view. In English classes, teachers overly emphasize "standard pronunciation" and even ridicule some "typical" ones. In fact, this is killing the possibility of students' progress, although this is not the intention of those teachers. First of all, the so-called "standard pronunciation" may not exist. Everyone's voice and tone are different. How can there be a "consistent standard"? Especially when using a foreign language. Secondly, because English itself is the language with the most "accents" in the world (no one else), if pronunciation is not "standard", then Irish, Canadian, and Indian people should not speak English- because they use neither "standard American pronunciation" nor "standard British pronunciation".

I'm not saying that pronunciation is not important, but it is only one of many factors that contribute to good expression. In a sense, those who are not good at pronunciation (let alone standard) but can express themselves freely are more worthy of envy (like Huang Xi) because they have already started on the road, rather than "forever" lingering at the starting point like most people.

Therefore, as someone who uses English as a second language, there is no need to feel inferior because of the non-standard, unpleasant, and unclear pronunciation. That is normal, natural, and inevitable. The use of language is essentially for communication. You should know that having a standard pronunciation does not necessarily mean that communication can be effective. Effective communication requires more factors such as vocabulary, grammar, logic, and content, all of which are more important than "standard pronunciation". Just imagine, when the United Nations is meeting, do all the representatives of each country use "standard British pronunciation"? Although every representative has to speak in English, using their own specific accent does not affect effective communication.

As an English user, don't be confused by English teachers. As teachers, part of their education is to emphasize "correct", "accurate", and "standard" - whether or not they themselves are really "correct", "accurate", and "standard". Sometimes it's quite sad. Most teachers have to raise their own requirements not because of their desire for progress, but because they want to meet the actual unreasonable expectations of "consumers". English teachers are also human, so most of them have the same psychological limitations or human limitations as others. When a person cannot do something, he pretends, and keeps pretending until he believes it himself - then he doesn't have to pretend anymore because he has reached the realm of "sincerely insincere". Those teachers who repeatedly emphasize "standard pronunciation" in the classroom (even if they are really "standard" themselves), have not seriously considered the side effects of what they are doing- scaring students, while they themselves get "respect" or "awe."

## 2. We are fully capable of significantly improving our pronunciation
Let's take a look at some scientific facts. There is no way to know exactly how many languages there are on Earth, but a conservative estimate is that there are over 6700 languages. Altogether, these languages use about 6000 sounds. Dr. Patricia K. Kuhl is a professor in the Department of Speech and Hearing Sciences at the University of Washington, and her research shows that newborn babies are actually capable of learning any language on Earth. In other words, newborn babies are actually "citizens of the world," and their brains are capable of processing any of the approximately 6000 sounds used in the more than 6700 languages.

Around the age of six months, babies begin to pay more attention to their native language. According to Professor Kuhl, this is because:

At this time, these babies are not "losing" their ability to distinguish speech sounds, but rather their brains are developing a set of filters that can filter out speech sounds that are unrelated to their native language or group similar sounds with those that exist in their native language. As a result, they are unable to distinguish certain speech sounds and the differences between certain speech sounds, which are unrelated to their native language. Later in the text, it will be mentioned that the brain needs such filters for another reason: to classify the same language spoken by people with different accents into one category, so that the brain can understand the language without error.

In fact, the sounds used in each language are limited. Swedish uses 16 vowels, English uses 8 vowels, Japanese uses only 5 vowels, and Chinese uses 6 vowels - one more than Japanese, which can indirectly explain why Chinese people find it slightly easier to learn English pronunciation than Japanese people. In some regions of our country, people cannot distinguish between the difference of "r" and "l." In their (adult) hearing, "row" and "low," "rake" and "lake" are indistinguishable. Around the age of 11 months, the filtering mechanism in their brain is already well developed, so they have changed from "citizens of the world" to "citizens of a language." By the age of 18 months, babies have somewhat started to pay attention to grammar phenomena and language patterns, such as being able to guess that words ending in "-ing" and "-ed" are usually verbs.

What is even more interesting in Professor Kuhl's research is that she further investigated the brain development of babies growing up in multilingual environments. There are some regions on Earth that are "naturally multilingual," such as Luxembourg in Europe and many ethnic minority areas in our country. The real impact on these children should be the "filtering mechanism" in their brains. Because they have received stimulation from multiple languages since childhood, their "filters" are different from monolingual users, so they can recognize more sounds.

Such research results obviously support the argument of "the critical period for language acquisition." Because the fact is there - another study shows that learning a second language after adulthood becomes more and more difficult. However, the same...

## 3. The biggest obstacle: fear of being ridiculed
Another important concern for those who are afraid to speak English is the fear of being ridiculed by people around them. It's really annoying. But think about it: Would a normal person make fun of a baby's unsteady steps? No. Would a normal person make fun of a disabled person? No, and they shouldn't. So, is it reasonable to ridicule someone who speaks a foreign language with an imperfect or unpleasant accent? Is it reasonable to ridicule someone who speaks a foreign language with an accent that they can't get rid of for their whole life?

There are always people around us who like to make fun of others. But making fun of others is foolish. If someone can make fun of another person just because they are better or do better in some aspect, then that person will eventually be made fun of by others. Who can be better than others in every aspect? Making fun of others is always destructive to them and cannot be constructive for oneself, because making fun of others does not improve one's own level, and at best only gives a false sense of happiness.

Babies learn to listen before they learn to speak. The fundamental reason why this is the case is that "speaking" is much harder than "listening" -- "listening" may only require "discrimination", but "speaking" requires the use of another organ to produce sound on the basis of a clear "discrimination", and often requires correction and adjustment. Therefore, in daily life, as long as a person has some basic ability, they can discern whether others' foreign language pronunciation is good or not, regardless of their own pronunciation. Interestingly, most of the ridicule comes from the feeling of "being lenient to oneself and strict to others," which is essentially worthless, and even the person who makes fun of others only gets a false sense of happiness.

Truly civilized people do not make fun of others. Civilized people may swear and curse in anger, but they will not insult others casually, let alone make fun of them, because they have already learned constructive criticism and respect for themselves and others. Only uncivilized people make fun of others. Making fun of others at will is shameful and even more uncivilized than spitting on the ground.

It is also difficult for those who do things well to make fun of others because they know how difficult it is to do something well, having experienced it themselves. A student once asked the cello maestro Pablo Casals why he still practiced for long hours every day, and he said, "Because I'm still improving every day!" It's hard to imagine such a master having the mindset and desire to make fun of others. Mr. Mei Lanfang, in his later years, taught his disciples how to sing opera and never criticized them. Whenever they made a mistake, Mr. Mei always said, "Practice again, it's hard to practice well...."

Therefore, don't be afraid of ridicule from others. If you make a mistake, just correct it. If you can't correct it, as long as you don't hurt others -- in fact, you can't hurt others with just a little accented English. Having an imperfect English pronunciation or a heavy accent is not your fault, and you have never, and are unlikely to have, caused any harm to others.

## 4. Listen More and More
To reshape our pronunciation, we should start with "rebuilding" our speech filter. We must relearn our ability to recognize the pronunciation used in the target language (e.g., English) because we often have difficulty distinguishing certain sounds. Attending various oral training courses often have little practical help beyond psychological comfort. The most effective method is actually zero-cost - dramatically increasing auditory input.

In the process of learning our native language, we are almost constantly exposed to auditory stimulation, but when learning a foreign language, this exposure is relatively meager. Based on my observation, most university students, despite claiming to have studied English for more than ten years, listen to English for no more than two hours a day, and never consistently for many days. To achieve the best results, we must ensure a large amount of input and, as mentioned earlier, this must be sustained for at least six months.

What many people may not realize is that "understanding" is not important here. The purpose of significantly increasing auditory input is to rebuild our ability to recognize pronunciation, not to improve our ability to understand text. At 18 months old, babies have already built their language filter for their native language, but they cannot fully understand what they hear every day. Professor Kuhl's research results suggest that English early education can be free: it doesn't matter if parents don't speak English, as long as they continuously play various English audios (rhymes, stories, TV shows, etc.) in the child's environment for a long period of time. If done this way, young children do not need to attend any training classes, and their "bilingual speech filters" should have already solidified by the time they start elementary school. In fact, I am very skeptical that various English early education programs take up too much time that could be used to acquire other skills, thereby limiting the development of young children's brains. However, we cannot expect children to learn a language just by listening to recordings and watching TV - as I just said, learning pronunciation is one thing, while learning a language requires many other forms of stimulation and effort. For adults, the same is true: significantly increasing auditory input is to quickly rebuild our own speech filters. After that, "understanding" becomes very important for making progress because only by understanding can we concentrate our attention, which is the fundamental prerequisite for all learning.

Another thing that many people don't think about is that "gradual progression" is not necessarily a good strategy, at least not when it comes to "rebuilding a speech filter". You should start listening to materials at normal speed right from the beginning. There is a well-known program on Voice of America (VOA) called Special English, which is a "beginner" or "intermediate" learning resource for many Chinese learners of English. There was a time when countless people took the risk of being accused of "listening to the enemy station" to listen to this program, just to learn English well. I believe that the program was designed with good intentions, as it believed that learning English should be a "gradual progression," and that normal speed and wording are too difficult for beginners; therefore, it only uses about 1500 "basic vocabulary" words, only uses the most basic grammar structures, and broadcasts at deliberately lowered speeds. But I am very skeptical about its real effect. My observation is that many people who start listening to VOA SE cannot put it down for long because the feeling of "being able to fully understand" is just too good. After a while, when they turn to listen to CNN or other materials at normal speed, they immediately feel challenged, and then "feel" that their "basics are not good enough," so they return to VOA SE. Many years have passed, and they are still listening to VOA SE. The most important reason is the same as the previous point: at this point, whether or not they can understand is not important; what is really important is to allow the auditory part of the brain to receive enough English speech stimulation for a long period of time.

Another seemingly unreasonable suggestion is "not to only listen to standard recordings." Many people's learning progress is halved because their approach is at odds with the "natural language acquisition process." The reason why the infant brain develops a "native language speech filter" is not only because it is easier to understand the native language this way, but also because the brain has to deal with many variants of the same speech - because the infant hears many different people using the same speech every day, and each person's pitch, tone, and timbre may have their own unique characteristics. Therefore, the brain must have such a filter that can classify different variants of the same speech into one category - only in this way can it process speech input without making mistakes. Therefore, when greatly increasing one's English auditory input, one should delve into different pitches, different timbres, different tones, and even different accents. In this sense, radio dramas are much stronger than textbook recordings because there are many people speaking, not just one "standard" voice from beginning to end. Therefore, I often advise my students not to limit their input materials to "standard American English" or "standard British English"; in fact, it doesn't matter, even strongly-accented "African American English" can be listened to, and the more diverse, the better. I often recommend CNN broadcasts, which feature various accents of English, and are really eye-opening.

More than 20 years ago, the equipment for learning English was very outdated, with the whole class using a desktop cassette player and listening to one tape flipped over for an entire semester. Nowadays, students can buy MP3 players that can hold countless materials at a very affordable price, and even their smartphones can play MP3s, which is very convenient. For the past decade or so, I have been recommending that my students use some language learning apps on their smartphones. One of the apps I often recommend is "LingQ". LingQ provides a platform for learners to learn languages by reading and listening to authentic

The first line in the image above may appear to be shorter than the second line, but in reality, both lines are the same length. Some people may even perceive the two squares in the top row as being smaller than the ones in the bottom row, but that is also an illusion. Similarly, some may feel that the bottom line is thicker than the top line, but that is also an illusion.

Whenever you feel discouraged because you think you're not making progress, it's helpful to remember this image and remind yourself that "perception isn't always accurate." Then recall Professor Paul Bach-y-Rita's explanation of the "plateau period." Regain your composure as soon as possible and get back to work.


## 6. Be lenient with yourself
"Being strict with yourself" is a good habit. But when trying to reshape your pronunciation, it is better to "be lenient with yourself". In practice, I even tell students that the first principle is not to overly pursue the "standard" - in fact, pursuing it is useless because no one can achieve the so-called "standard" in a short period of time.

People who use different languages have different habits in their oral movements. A newborn baby cannot speak because they do not yet know how to use their lips, tongue, throat, vocal cords, and other organs, nor do they know how to control airflow to produce different sounds. They need to listen, observe, distinguish, imitate, and correct repeatedly before they can start babbling. It takes several years or even longer for children to achieve clear articulation - of course, a considerable number of people may never achieve clear articulation in their lifetime (such as Mr. Jay Chou, whom many of us are familiar with).

Once the various organs participating in voice production adapt to a language, they will gradually become more accustomed to performing certain movements, while at the same time, it becomes increasingly difficult to make movements that are not commonly used or even not used at all in their native language. When speaking a foreign language, if it is difficult to make certain oral movements, the various organs will combine to make a relatively closest movement involuntarily, so that the final sound produced sounds like another one. For example, most Koreans find it difficult to produce the sound "v" because it does not exist in their language. Therefore, even after studying the pronunciation tutorials, the sound they produce by "copying" will always be "b". The same principle applies to many southerners who cannot produce consonants "f", "n", or cannot distinguish between nasal consonants. They may say "pihu" instead of "pifu" for "skin", "luzi" instead of "nvzi" for "woman", or "nulang" instead of "nulian" for "women's basketball"...

I have a Korean friend who always says "video" as "bideo". At first, I was not used to it and unconsciously corrected him once or twice, but I found that he didn't seem to know that he was saying "video" as "bideo" and seemed to think he had been saying "video" all along. One day, I teased him by imitating his pronunciation of "video" as "bideo", and he immediately jumped up (without realizing that I was joking) and said, "Ha, you are pronouncing it wrong. That word should be pronounced as 'bideo'!" - This is when I realized that there are such interesting things: people who mispronounce cannot hear that their own pronunciation is wrong, but the same mistake made by others can be instantly recognized by them. So I thought, "I myself may have such moments too." Later, I found out that it was indeed the case. It was just that I mispronounced and did not know that I was wrong with other sounds.

Many pronunciation tutorials, although their starting point is justified, explain the process of each pronunciation in too much detail and complexity, making it difficult to learn. In fact, it's enough to just get a general idea. This doesn't mean that the principles of pronunciation shouldn't be learned; on the contrary, they should be learned well. However, the fact is that even if you don't learn them temporarily, it's not entirely impossible — just by listening and speaking more, you'll gradually get closer to the standard. However, most people misunderstand the "listening and speaking more" part, thinking that "more" means just one or two hours, or one or two days, or one or two months. In reality, "more" means at least one or two years without interruption. Some people claim to have studied for many years, but the truth is that the time they actually spent practicing was too sporadic and too far apart, equivalent to zero. So in fact, more and more intensive practice is needed.

When people learn foreign language pronunciation, they usually unconsciously set their short-term goals too high, which inevitably leads to unimaginable frustration because they set themselves an unattainable goal. Teachers often have high expectations of their students and start criticizing their pronunciation as soon as they begin, rushing to correct them prematurely. In fact, students also have too high expectations of themselves, and it's impossible to expect themselves to have perfect pronunciation when they first start learning. After practicing for a while, they should study the pronunciation principles in the tutorial more carefully, try to understand various rules, and then correct themselves by applying these knowledge through repeated practice. However, the most important thing is to speak and practice more. As long as you listen, speak and practice enough, anyone can do well.

## 7. Slow down your speaking speed
Looking back, I realized that I, like many others, have made many basic mistakes. For example, I used to think that "speaking fast" means "speaking fluently". With a little observation and thought, one should know that "fast" and "fluent" are not the same thing.

In fact, many Chinese students complain that normal-speed English is "too fast and incomprehensible", but when they speak English themselves, they speak much faster than foreigners - this is not an easy phenomenon to observe or explain clearly. People often confuse cause and effect. When listening to a foreign language, it is not because "they speak too fast that I can't understand", but because "I can't understand, so I feel they speak too fast".

For example, if you hear a word in a sentence that you don't know, like "idiosyncratic", what you heard at the time was a string of syllables that you don't know the meaning of, so your brain will involuntarily try to think (even guess) what it is - this requires time and effort (even in milliseconds). In an unskilled situation, our brains find it difficult to handle more than one task at a time, and while you are thinking hard, the speaker may continue to speak, so you may "miss" some information - of course you feel that they speak too fast.

Understanding this causal relationship is actually very important, because it is one of the important reasons why many people cannot speak English well. Because they misunderstand this causal relationship, many people when speaking English, especially when they want to speak "good" English (such as during exams or interviews), will involuntarily speed up, not only fast but too fast, and may end up speaking so fast that foreigners cannot understand.

Even without this factor, Chinese people still speak English faster involuntarily. The reason is that each Chinese character is composed of a consonant and a vowel, and the Chinese vowels are not distinguished by length. English is different - vowels not only have length differences, but also differences between short and long, and there is another "short" vowel that is slightly longer than other short vowels and slightly shorter than long vowels: /æ/ (readers may listen to the pronunciation of "ab" and "ebb" in Webster's Dictionary and distinguish /æ/ and /e/). Therefore, when Chinese students say "apple", they actually say "epple" (fortunately, this word does not exist, so it will not be confused by the listener); most Chinese students say "important" as /ɪmpɔtənt/, rather than /ɪmpɔːtənt/, even though they also know that the word "beach" means something else if it is pronounced short; for example, the diphthong /aɪ/, Chinese students also almost always read it as the Chinese word "爱" (ai).

Because each long vowel is pronounced as a short vowel, Chinese students speak faster than foreigners by "half a beat" in some places without realizing it, and without realizing it, they can speak several beats faster than foreigners in a sentence... Therefore, when practicing shadowing at the beginning, you need to compete with yourself, on the one hand, you need to overcome the desire to speak "fast", and on the other hand, you need to consciously prevent yourself from speaking too fast.

## 8. Pausing is more important than linking sounds
Perhaps because people always unconsciously want to speak faster when speaking a foreign language, when studying the characteristics of natural language flow, they tend to pay more attention to "linking sounds". In fact, linking sounds may be the least important feature of all natural language flow features. The reason is simple: if you are fluent in the language, you will naturally link the sounds together, and if you are not, you will forcefully do so, which sounds awkward.

Another difference between English and Chinese is that the basic unit in Chinese is "characters", which consists of one consonant and one vowel, that is, each character has only one syllable. The basic unit in English, on the other hand, is "words", which may consist of one or more syllables. The English equivalent of the Chinese "word" is the "phrase". The longest English word is said to be made up of 189,819 characters, which is the chemical name of the largest known protein, "titin". Nobody knows how many syllables are in that word, and I wonder if I'll ever meet someone who can pronounce that word? The longest word in an English dictionary is made up of 45 characters - "pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis". Even the electronic version (ver. 3.0) of Webster's Dictionary does not have a human pronunciation file for it. To hear how the word is pronounced, you can only make do with the Microsoft speech engine - it can be found in the "Concise English-Chinese Dictionary" in Kingsoft PowerWord.

Because many English words consist of multiple syllables (the word starting with "pneu" has a total of 18 syllables!), English syllables are classified into stressed and unstressed. To pronounce a stressed syllable as a stress, there is a very important detail to note - there must be a pause before the stressed syllable - it can be very short or very exaggerated. The presence of this pause makes it possible to clearly pronounce the stressed syllable.

For example, when practicing the word "especially", you can exaggerate a little. Divide the word into two parts starting from the stressed syllable: "e"|"specially". After pronouncing "e", close your mouth (preparing to pronounce "spe") and wait for a full second, then forcefully pronounce "spe" and "cially" immediately afterwards. Doesn't the "spe" syllable sound clearer? You can practice with more words, such as: un|fortunately, im|portant, under|stand, edu|cation, par|ticular, fi|nancial...

In our native language, every character in a word is spoken uniformly and continuously without any pauses - for example, "uneven" and "sobbing" in Chinese - so we are not used to pauses when speaking English words. However, in the minds of English speakers, a word can indeed be broken down into separate parts. There are many examples that illustrate this well, such as in Hollywood movies, where people often say "absolutely" as "ab-fucking-solutely" or "abso-fucking-lutely".

Interestingly, in the pronunciation of words in dictionaries (recordings of human pronunciation), although only a single word is pronounced, there is often no noticeable pause before the stressed syllable (which may be precisely because only a single word is being pronounced). This may also be why most beginners rarely notice the existence of this pause.

When reading a word, there may be pauses within it, let alone when reading a sentence. Therefore, mastering the use of pauses is essential for achieving natural English intonation and rhythm.

## 9. Many times, it's not that our pronunciation is "incorrect," but that we simply mispronounce the word altogether!
When we are ridiculed for our poor pronunciation, the person doing the ridiculing often lacks the patience to tell us exactly what we're doing wrong, how we're doing it wrong, and how we can correct it. Of course, it's possible that they themselves don't know, or have never seriously thought about it. In almost all cases, we rarely see a native English speaker mocking us second-language learners for having poor pronunciation. In fact, as long as our pronunciation isn't to a certain degree poor, native speakers are often "surprised" and say, "Wow, your English is really good!" This is especially true for foreigners who have spent time in China, because they understand how difficult it is to learn a foreign language. Of course, they may not know that the Chinese they're learning is the most difficult foreign language to learn on the planet. I rarely (and I assume others are the same) encounter someone who is doing very well, and yet mocks others who aren't. That's because those who truly reach the pinnacle know just how difficult it is to get there. When teaching students, the late great Mei Lanfang was incredibly patient; when a student made a mistake, Mr. Mei would simply say, "Doing well is very difficult..." This is probably the reason why.

In fact, many times (and probably more often than not), our so-called "poor pronunciation" is not because we are mispronouncing certain English phonemes, but because we are simply mispronouncing the entire word. One word that stands out in my memory is "façade." When I first saw this word, it wasn't written as "façade," but rather as "facade." There is no "ç" letter in English (a "c" with a tail); so I assumed it was pronounced as /ˈfækeɪd/ - and I thought I pronounced it very well! Like most students, I used to mispronounce "specific" as /ˈspesɪfɪk/ instead of /spɘˈsɪfɪk/. Generally speaking, most Chinese university students will mispronounce at least three of the following five words: "cellist," "façade," "heir," "niche," and "specific." I used to mispronounce all of them.

Therefore, 1) it is essential to brush up on phonetics; 2) when looking up a word, be sure to read the pronunciation key and make corresponding marks on your own text; 3) don't assume the pronunciation of a word. The last one is particularly important. For example, many people learn the word "penalty" before learning "penalize," so they inadvertently pronounce "penalize" as /ˈpenəˌlaɪz/ instead of /ˈpɪnəˌlaɪz/. Another example is the three words "economy," "economics," and "economist." The first syllable of "economics" is pronounced /e/, while the first syllable of the other two is /ɪ/. Many people get confused, not to mention the fact that they often misplace the stress in each word.

To avoid embarrassment caused by assuming too much, it's best to look up every word you learn in the dictionary. This is an era of abundant and advanced learning tools; people from just ten years ago could never have imagined the convenience of learning today.

## 10. It's essential to learn phonetics
Phonetics is very important, and everyone knows that. However, many people find learning phonetics particularly difficult. Some even lose confidence in continuing to study English because of it. Their thinking is somewhat justified. Think about it, what is phonetics? Isn't it just like the pinyin system in Chinese? Why is it so difficult to learn a phonetic system? Do I really lack the talent?

However, when we first learned pinyin, the situation we faced was quite different from when we later learned phonetics. Many people were already taught pinyin in kindergarten. However, at that time, whether they learned it well or not was not that important. Kindergarten teachers knew that their goal was not necessarily to make sure students mastered pinyin but to teach it anyway. Later, in the early years of primary school, we had to learn pinyin again. Upon careful reflection, even just "learning it again" was not sufficient. In fact, what really mattered was the continuous use of pinyin for three to five years, as we constantly referred to it when looking up words in the dictionary (do you remember carrying the "Xinhua Dictionary" in your school bag when you were young? - Of course, later on, there was a period when this dictionary was replaced with the larger and thicker "Modern Chinese Dictionary"). It was this long-term application that made us instinctively proficient in using Chinese pinyin. In other words, most of us had to go through at least two systematic learning phases and then continue to use it for several years to acquire something that now seems extremely simple to us.

Chinese is our native language, and we already have several years of language experience before going to school - we didn't start speaking only when we started school. In fact, most people started learning to recognize characters in kindergarten (some even earlier). That means when we were learning pinyin, we already knew how to speak, could understand a significant amount of language, and already had a vocabulary that exceeded a certain threshold. Once we acquired pinyin, our reading speed increased significantly. As a result, most people had learned around three thousand commonly used Chinese characters (or at least the majority of them) by the end of their first three years of primary school. In other words, when we were learning English, we first learned phonetics too quickly and at a very early stage. Surprisingly, phonetics even had to become the starting course for teaching pronunciation - even though we learned pinyin in Chinese only after we had already developed a basic level of pronunciation ability (we were capable of it).

Therefore, in a sense, learning phonetics is indeed a difficult hurdle. However, once the mechanism is understood, it is possible to figure out the right way to "master phonetics easily." First, don't rush to achieve mastery. Second, master phonetics through extensive repeated practice. Third, use extensive reading exercises to unconsciously overcome the initial obstacles of phonetic development. Personally, I believe that one can only have the basic ability to master phonetics easily when their pronunciation reaches a normal level (or close to it). Once the foundation of phonetics is acquired, it needs to be applied constantly until we understand English phonetics just like we understand Chinese pinyin.

Chinese students studying phonetics face another difficulty. Most of our textbooks use the D.J. phonetic system (British English), but it's not the only phonetic system. Apart from D.J., some places use the K.K. phonetic system (American English). Despite claiming to use the IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet), Oxford and Cambridge dictionaries differ to some extent. And some students, following the advice of their seniors, start using the Merriam-Webster dictionary when preparing for the SAT or GRE, only to find that it uses a completely different phonetic system. In fact, almost all dictionaries on the market use different phonetic systems. Something that is already challenging to learn becomes even more discouraging due to the existence of so many versions.

"Fortunately, today's students have the opportunity to use better learning tools - dictionaries have long become electronic dictionaries. Most electronic dictionaries or dictionary software on computers are equipped with authentic pronunciation. So, when you look up a word, even if you don't recognize the phonetic symbols, you can listen to the pronunciation of that word. However, it is still better to be able to write the phonetic symbols by hand because after looking up words in the dictionary, it is best to make a note on the text for easier memorization in the future. At this point, the goal of learning phonetic symbols somewhat changes - for most people, these markings are not for others to see, but for themselves, so as long as they can recognize them, it's good enough (although it's better to be consistent everywhere).

In fact, I have long discovered that the "unique" and "hybrid" system I use when marking phonetic symbols in texts. For example, I started using /ɛ/ instead of /e/ at some point, and since I leaned towards American English, I often added the voicing symbol /t̬/ under /t/. Even after leaning towards American English, I still didn't get used to using /ɚ/, but used /ər/ instead. Even when I initially learned K.K. phonetic symbols, I didn't like writing /a/ by hand and wrote /ɑ/ instead... Nevertheless, I have never felt that this "chaotic" system has had any impact on my further learning. I can use it well.

Here is a summary of a phonetic learning strategy:

* First, make sure you have enough reading experience. For example, read aloud for at least an hour every day (listening to recorded readings of textbooks is fine) for at least three months. Through this process, most languages are grasped well enough (it takes a long time to approach the "standard"), and then learning phonetic symbols becomes guaranteed.
* Only learn one system completely. If you are still in junior high school, you can choose D.J. phonetic symbols or K.K. phonetic symbols - that is, the one used in your textbook. If you have been studying English for many years, then you should use the phonetic symbol system used in the dictionary you are currently using and use the most frequently.
* It is best to use the voiced version of the dictionary on the computer so that you can look up all the example words and record them as mp3 files. Practice reading them repeatedly.
* Copy the phonetic symbols of each example word according to the phonetic chart several times (preferably more than 7 times).
* Copy the example word list, then write down the corresponding phonetic symbols from memory, and then check them (at least twice).
* Whenever you look up a word, mark the phonetic symbols next to the original text.
* It is necessary to take the time to learn the English spelling rules. Ignoring spelling rules is a mistake made by the majority of English learners. They would rather learn "root words and affixes" that seem to be more efficient or feel more "advanced" than learning the most basic and lifelong applicable spelling rules.

In fact, many people don't want to write phonetic symbols because they find it troublesome. Although they often encounter the embarrassment of "Hmm, I've looked up this word, but how do I pronounce it?", obviously, these embarrassments are not enough to make them determine to be meticulous from then on - so the cost of being meticulous accumulates more and more until it reaches a level that most people are unwilling to bear.

In fact, with a slight modification in the approach, it's not that complicated. For example, when looking up the word "façade," you don't necessarily have to transcribe the phonetic symbols as [fə'sɑːd] in full. Instead, you can simply mark /s/ above the letter "ç," mark /ɑː/ above the second letter "a," and then add the stress symbol before /s/. After all, the letter "f" can only be pronounced as /f/, the letter "d" as /d/, and the last letter "e" is silent. This is the rule for the majority of English words. Similarly, when looking up "résumé," the most important thing is to mark the stressed /'ei/ above the last letter "e." As for those words that perfectly adhere to the spelling rules (in fact, over 96% of English words), there's no need to annotate the phonetic symbols extensively. For example, in the word "ichthyosaur," the pronunciation of "ch" is /k/, "yo" is /ɪə/, and "aur" is /ɔː/. The stress falls on the first syllable. In fact, it seems that marking the stressed syllable alone is sufficient. Of course, some people may argue for marking /k/ above "ch," but in any case, there's no need to write such a long string: ['ɪkθɪəsɔː]. In rare cases where a letter in a word is silent, such as the "b" in the word "debt," I simply draw a line over that letter with a pencil to remind myself that it's not pronounced.

Usually, I always mark the stress on polysyllabic words and then indicate the pronunciation of vowel combinations that may have multiple pronunciations in the current word. Only in a few cases do I need to mark specific consonants because most consonants are pronounced the same as their corresponding letters.

In today's world, excellent English learning resources are readily available. I often recommend the following two resources to students:

For learning British pronunciation and its phonetic symbols, you can use the Flash tutorial "Guide to English Phonetic Symbols" from Oxford University Press Hong Kong Chinese version.
For learning American pronunciation and its phonetic symbols, you can use the online learning program "Phonetics: The Sound of American English" from the University of Iowa.

## 11. Syllable Division
The division of syllables in most words, based on spelling and based on phonetic spelling, is similar. For example, "pri•ma•ry" /ˈprai-mə-ri/ and "ich•thyo•saur" /ˈɪk-θɪə-sɔː/. However, there are many words where the syllable division based on spelling differs significantly from that based on phonetic spelling, such as "tax•i" /ˈtek-si/ and "cur•dling" /ˈkər-də-liŋ/.

In our textbooks, the syllable division is based on spelling rather than phonetic spelling. The purpose of syllable division is mainly to correctly mark the pronunciation of words so that learners can read them accurately. If that's the case, syllable division based on spelling may not be as meaningful as division based on phonetic spelling. And if there are other purposes for syllable division, it could be to assist in remembering the spelling of words. However, syllable division based on phonetic spelling can also be used to aid in remembering the spelling of words. Regardless of the method used for syllable division, the same pronunciation rules need to be learned for it to serve as a mnemonic. (As for other purposes of syllable division, I'm not really aware of them.)

Furthermore, if students only learn (assuming they have truly mastered it) syllable division based on spelling, they are likely to fall into the trap of making assumptions. For example, the word "create" is actually two syllables /kriː-ˈeɪt/, but many beginners (due to having recently learned some pronunciation rules) unintentionally perceive it as a monosyllabic word. I have seen many students pronounce this word as /kriːt/, most likely for this reason.

Therefore, as English learners, the syllable division method based on phonetic spelling may be more useful for us.

Syllable division based on spelling is very cumbersome and verbose. I don't remember any teacher explaining the "syllable juncture rule" clearly to me, but I did come across it in some book. After reading it several times, I found it particularly impractical and even useless for English learners. On the other hand, syllable division based on phonetic spelling is straightforward and follows one crucial principle: a syllable must have one and only one vowel.

The following are common syllable structures (these examples are all monosyllabic words):

* Vowel: a /eɪ/, eye /aɪ/
* Consonant + Vowel: tea /tiː/, bay /beɪ/
* Consonant + Consonant + Vowel: fly /flaɪ/, sky /skaɪ/
* Vowel + Consonant: ebb /eb/, odd /ɔd/
* Consonant + Vowel + Consonant: beep /biːp/, big /bɪg/
* Vowel + Consonant + Consonant: east /iːst/, axe /æks/
* Consonant + Consonant + Vowel + Consonant: stop /stɔp/, bleed /bliːd/
* Consonant + Vowel + Consonant + Consonant: last /læst/, lapse /læps/
* Consonant + Consonant + Vowel + Consonant + Consonant: blast /blæst/, frost /frɔːst/

For multisyllabic words, you can apply the patterns mentioned above and see how many syllables fit those patterns. The guiding principle is simple: for multisyllabic words, apart from the final syllable, the majority of syllables usually follow the first five patterns among the nine mentioned.

## 12. Stressed and Unstressed Syllables in Natural Speech
As mentioned earlier, many English words are polysyllabic, meaning they consist of multiple syllables. If an English word has multiple syllables, at least one of the syllables is stressed. If there are enough syllables, there may be secondary stress as well (e.g., "archaeopteryx") or more than one stressed syllable (e.g., "postmodernism"). Similarly, in a sentence with multiple words, at least one word will be stressed, while the other words will be unstressed. (For convenience, the terms "unstressed," "secondary stress," and "stress" are used to represent the light, medium, and heavy pronunciation of syllables within words, while "weak stress" and "strong stress" are used to represent the stress patterns of words within a sentence.)

Understanding the patterns of stressed and unstressed syllables is key to achieving natural speech flow. Once you grasp the rules of stressed and unstressed syllables, even if certain phonemes are not pronounced perfectly, your speech will still sound natural and be easier for others to understand. In American thriller movies, for example, we often hear foreign spies like Russian or Iranian agents speaking English. Despite their noticeable accents, they not only speak fluently but also communicate without barriers, while the other side speaks "standard authentic" American English and can understand them despite their accents. This situation illustrates that while individual phoneme pronunciation is important, there is clearly something more important to focus on, such as the stressed and unstressed syllable patterns we are discussing.

The following are the first two sentences from the TOEFL listening recording. Pay attention to the specific differences between the word "community" when it appears for the first and second time:

"Community service is an important component of education here at our university. We encourage all students to volunteer for at least one community activity before they graduate..."

Please pay close attention to the two occurrences of "community" in the recording. The first "Community" is stressed, so the second syllable /mju:/ is pronounced with fullness, tone, and higher pitch. In contrast, the second "community" is unstressed, so the second syllable /mju:/ becomes shorter and lacks a noticeable tone.

In this recording, all the stressed words are emphasized in the following text (the words without emphasis are unstressed):

Community service is an important component of education here at our university. We encourage all students to volunteer for at least one community activity before they graduate.

When a word is stressed or unstressed, the length of its vowels and the location of stress (for multisyllabic words) will change accordingly. The common changes include:

If a word is pronounced with weak stress, the following characteristics typically apply:

* Long vowels become shorter (almost equivalent to short vowels in length).
* Stressed syllables become as light as unstressed syllables.
* Many vowels tend to move closer to /ə/.
* The vowel /ə/ after light consonants /s/, /t/, /k/, /f/ may be omitted.
* The overall pitch of the word tends to be "low," "mid," or at most "mid-high."
* In fact, even when pronouncing a single word in isolation, the length of vowels is influenced by the stress. For example, in the word "city," with the stress on the first syllable, both /i/ sounds are the same: /ˈsi-ti/. However, if you emphasize the first syllable enough, you naturally perceive the first /i/ as longer than the second /i/.

Most auxiliary verbs, linking verbs, prepositions, conjunctions, articles, and pronouns have two pronunciations: strong and weak forms. These words are often monosyllabic. In natural speech, they are more frequently pronounced in their weak forms. Here is a list of the most common and widespread strong and weak pronunciations. It's important to note that this list describes patterns but should not be used as a strict rule. Not all function words must always be pronounced weak, and not all content words must be pronounced strong.

* a: /eɪ/→/ə/
* am: /æm/→/əm, m/
* an: /æn/→/ən, n/
* and: /ænd/→/ənd, nd, ən, n/
* any: /'eni/→/ni/
* are: /a:/→/ə/
* as: /æs/→/əz/
* at: /æt/→/ət/
* but: /bʌt/→/bət/
* can: /kæn/→/kən, kn, kŋ/
* could: /kud/→/kəd, kd/
* do: /duː/→/du, də, d/
* does: /dʌz/→/dəz, z, s/
* for: /fɔː/→/fə/
* from: /frɔm/→/frəm, frm/
* had: /hæd/→/həd, əd, d/
* has: /hæz/→/həz, əz, z, s/
* have: /hæv/→/həv, əv, v/
* he: /hiː/→/hi, iː, i/
* her: /həː/→/hə, əː, ə/
* him: /him/→/im/
* his: /hiz/→/iz/
* I: /ai/→/aː, ə/
* is: /iz/→/s, z/
* many: /'meni/→/mni/
* me: /miː/→/mi/
* must: /mʌst/→/məst, məs/
* my: /mai/→/mi/
* of: /əv/→/əv, v, ə/
* our: /ɑʊɚ/→/ar/
* shall: /ʃæl/→/ʃəl, ʃl/
* she: /ʃiː/→/ʃi/
* should: /ʃud/→/ʃəd, ʃd, ʃt/
* so: /səʊ/→/sə/
* some: /sʌm/→/səm, sm/
* such: /sʌʧ/→/səʧ/
* than: /ðæn/→/ðən, ðn/
* that: /ðæt/→/ðət/
* the: /ði:/→/ði, ðə/
* them: /ðem/→/ðəm, ðm, əm, m/
* then: /ðen/→/ðən/
* to: /tuː/→/tu, tə/
* us: /us/→/əs/
* was: /wɔz/→/wəz, wə/
* we: /wiː/→/wi/
* were: /wəː/→/wə/
* when: /wen/→/wən/
* will: /wil/→/əl, l/
* would: /wud/→/wəd, əd, d/
* you: /juː/→/ju/

In TOEFL listening, the weak forms of these words are particularly common. For example, the word "our" is often pronounced as /ar/. For instance, in the following two sentences:

I hope you've all finished reading the assigned chapter on insurance -- so that you're prepared for our discussion today. (Passage 2, Sentence 1)

One of our main jobs is to keep detailed records of the migration patterns of raptors. (Passage 90, Sentence 3)

## 13. Carefully Pronouncing /t/, /d/, and /s/
In the process of learning, it is often the easier content that students tend to overlook, resulting in self-imposed difficulties. The pronunciation of /t/, /d/, and /s/ in English is one such area of knowledge.

The /t/ and /d/ sounds in English are different from the [t] sound in Chinese Pinyin, although they may sound very similar. The same applies to /d/ and /s/. However, since [t], [d], and [s] in Chinese are quite close to /t/, /d/, and /s/ in English, most Chinese students simply replace /t/, /d/, and /s/ with [t], [d], and [s]. Initially, it may be hard to perceive any significant consequences or fatal impact caused by this substitution. However, once a bad habit is formed, it becomes difficult to correct and becomes a stumbling block for many learners.

Let's try saying the following simple sentences in Chinese:


> 我踢——死—你……
> 我打——死—你……

Say them a few more times. Intentionally elongate the sound of "踢" (kick), which will help you perceive the starting position of the tongue for the [t] sound in Chinese. The tip of the tongue should touch the teeth and then leave while the air flow in the oral cavity vibrates. Additionally, you can also perceive the starting position of [d] (when saying "打" - hit) and [s] (when saying "死" - die) in Chinese pronunciation. In the IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet) notation, there is a special symbol for dental [t] and [d] sounds, where the tip of the tongue touches the teeth: /t̪/, /d̪/ (please note the small "bridge" symbol under t/d).

【Note】The illustrations of the oral cavity used in this series of articles are excerpted from the online tutorial "Phonetics: The sounds of American English" by the University of Iowa.



As shown in the above picture, the /t/ sound in English does not have the tip of the tongue touching the teeth but rather the upper alveolar ridge, a little above the junction of teeth and gums. Therefore, the /t/ sound in English is different from the [t] sound in Chinese - the Chinese [t] sound creates more obstruction to the airflow. Similarly, the starting position of the tongue for /d/ in English is also at the same location:



Furthermore, the starting position of the tongue for /s/ in English is not against the upper teeth. The starting position of the tongue for /s/ is roughly the same as /t/ and /d/, but it does not touch the upper alveolar ridge; instead, there is a slight gap (as shown in the figure below). Again, due to the difference in the starting position of the tongue, there is a significant difference between the /s/ sound in English and the [s] sound in Chinese.



Practicing these consonants is not difficult. Readers only need to practice a single word repeatedly: "student". After practicing this word multiple times, practice "students" - it is evident that the starting position of the /ts/ sound in English should be the same as the /t/ sound, and /dz/ should be the same as /d/.
> We encourage all **students** to volunteer for at least one community activity before they graduate. A new community program called "One On One" helps elementary **students** who've fallen behind.

"There are two instances of 'students' here, so it's worth imitating and experiencing repeatedly. If you're already familiar with this starting position of the tip of the tongue, then when you read words like 'teacher' and 'particular' in the future, you will feel that their pronunciation is very different from before the correction.

Due to the different starting positions of the tip of the tongue, compared to the English /t/, /d/, and /s/, the Chinese [t], [d], and [s] block more airflow during pronunciation. [t] and [d] almost completely block the airflow, and although [s] requires airflow to pass through the tip of the tongue, the tip of the tongue still obstructs the airflow more than when producing /s/. Many of us feel that when speaking with foreigners, they seem to 'deliver more air' and have a greater sense of airflow vibration, and this is the reason.

There is also a fun exercise. Replace all the [t], [d], and [s] in the Chinese phrases 'I will kick you to death' and 'I will beat you to death' with the English /t/, /d/, and /s/ explained above. Practice this repeatedly, and eventually, when you say these two phrases, they will sound like a foreigner speaking Chinese.

Furthermore, in this sentence, there is a very clear liaison, 'helps_elementary...'. Please experience and practice it repeatedly. Recall the section on 'pauses'—when practicing this liaison, the key is to first produce the /hel/ syllable and close your mouth (which means you've already formed the mouth shape for /p/), then pause for a sufficient amount of time, and then produce the /s/ sound while starting to read the following word. Additionally, emphasize the stressed syllable in the word 'elementary' (i.e., the first syllable), and this stressed syllable also has a rising intonation. Once you understand these points, you will find that so-called 'liaison' is just a natural occurrence.

There is more in-depth explanation about /t/ and /d/ in the following content."

## 14. "Let's talk about the consonant /l/ and how to overcome liaison. 

This sound is not much different from the /l/ in Chinese. The difference is that in English, many syllables follow the /l/ sound after a vowel, while in Chinese, there is only /l/ as an initial sound followed by a vowel (equivalent to a vowel in English). It is likely that because Chinese does not have situations where a vowel is followed by the sound /l/, many Chinese students struggle with the /l/ sound at the end of syllables. (Some students from southern China also have difficulty distinguishing between /l/ and /n/, which is a separate issue related to their native language and not English.)

Most students have no problem with words where /l/ is at the beginning of a syllable, such as 'law,' 'value,' 'fly,' and so on. When pronouncing the /l/ in these words, it is almost the same as when saying the Chinese phrase 'Have you eaten?' It doesn't require much effort. However, when they pronounce words with /l/ at the end of a syllable, they make mistakes. For example, 'lawful,' 'valuable,' 'financial,' 'still,' and so on. Many students pronounce these words as /ˈlɔːfəu/, /ˈvæljəbəu/, /faɪˈnænʃəu/, and /ˈstɪəu/, respectively, with the ending of each word pronounced as the letter 'o.'

The main reason for this mistake is that the accurate pronunciation of the /l/ sound requires continuous movement of the tongue inside the oral cavity. Since all the important movements occur inside the oral cavity and the movement of the tongue cannot be observed from the outside, learning this sound is similar to the effect of a blind person touching an elephant for many people.

When pronouncing these words, the endings are mostly /əl/, not /əu/. When pronouncing /əu/, the tongue almost doesn't move inside the oral cavity. However, when pronouncing /əl/, the tongue does move. Starting from the /ə/ sound, the tip of the tongue moves toward the alveolar ridge until it touches the ridge, and that is considered the end of the sound. The incomplete or missing movement of the tongue causes most students to pronounce /əl/ as /əu/.

Repeatedly read those words and experience the pronunciation change brought by the movement of the tongue sliding to touch the alveolar ridge: 'lawful,' 'valuable,' 'financial,' 'still.'

Now, please try to read the following sentence several times until you become familiar with it:

'I'm sure you'll enjoy this community service, and you'll gain valuable experience at the same time.'

Now, carefully listen to the recording of this text: the fourth-to-last sentence in Recording 1. Beginners will immediately notice that their pronunciation differs significantly from the recording. In the recording, the /l/ sound at the end of two words connects with the following vowel at the beginning of the adjacent word:

'I'm sure you'll_enjoy this community service, and you'll_experience at the same time.'

"Now, let's carefully listen to the recording of this passage: the fourth sentence from the end of Article 1. Beginners will immediately notice a clear difference between their own pronunciation and the recording. In the recording, the final /l/ sounds of two words are linked with the following vowel at the beginning of the adjacent word:

I'm sure you'll_enjoy this community service, and you'll gain valuable_experience at the same time.

First, let's see how to pronounce "valuable experience" to match the recording. If the tongue tip is not on the alveolar ridge when the /əl/ at the end of "valuable" is finished, then in order to achieve the "linking" effect in the recording, the movement of the tongue tip needs to be restarted, resulting in an awkward sound. Therefore, it is essential to have a complete tongue movement when pronouncing /əl/. Furthermore, using the knowledge about "pauses" mentioned earlier, in order to clearly articulate the stressed syllable /ˈpɪ/, deliberately exaggerate the pause before it. Pronounce it as /ˌvæ-ljə-bə-liks-...-ˈpɪ-rɪəns/. After the pronunciation of /liks/, close your lips, wait for a moment, and then slightly exert some force to pronounce /ˈpɪ/. With practice, you will be able to master it. The same principle applies to "you'll enjoy" in the previous sentence.

If you still feel that it sounds very stiff, there is another aspect that needs improvement. The reason why the linking after improving the tongue tip position at the end of /l/ still feels awkward is usually because the stress in the following word is not clearly emphasized. During practice, intentionally emphasize the stressed syllable of the second word:

You'll_enjoy, valuable_experience

If the following word after a word ending in /l/ begins with a stressed syllable, then the entire /l+vowel/ will be stressed. For example, "real audio" will be pronounced as /ri-ˈlɔ:-diəʊ/.

Now, let's carefully listen to the following sentence:

Professor Dodge will_act as a mentor to the tutors... (Sentence 9 of Article 1)

If we talk about "linking," the important thing to note is that in connected words, the stressed syllable of the second word must be articulated clearly (in fact, if the following word is not stressed, the linking effect will not naturally occur, or even if it does, it won't be very noticeable). And in order to articulate the stressed syllable clearly, there may need to be a slight pause before it.

Do you see it? The so-called "linking" is not intentionally connected; it naturally occurs when the articulation of the preceding consonant is complete. Even the so-called "sound changes" that will be explained later follow the same principle. It's not something intentional, but rather something that happens naturally. Linking is not as important as many teachers claim it to be, and the solution cannot be to link for the sake of linking. That would only address the symptoms and not the root cause.

As for other consonants, they are generally much easier for Chinese students compared to /l/, and there is no need to practice them specifically (we have already discussed the most important ones, /t/, /d/, and /s/). With more shadowing, reading aloud, and speaking practice, everything will naturally improve."

## 15. Mastering Voicing: Starting with /t/
/t/ is truly a consonant that is worth spending time and effort on, even after this section is over.

After learning that the tongue placement for /t/ is different from the Chinese sound [t], it's important to know another significant feature of /t/: when /t/ is sandwiched between two vowels, it becomes voiced. The most obvious example is the word "city." Since there are vowels before and after /t/, when pronounced, it is no longer /t/ but /t̬/ (please note the small "v" diacritic under the t). Another example is the word "meet," pronounced as /miːt/, but when adding "ing," it becomes /ˈmiːt̬ɪŋ/—/t/ changes to /t̪/, sounding very close to /d/. /t/ is referred to as a "voiceless consonant" because of this, while /d/ is considered a "voiced consonant" due to the vocal cord vibration during its pronunciation.

In natural speech flow, there are many cases where /t/ is sandwiched between two vowels since many words end with /t/ and many words begin with a vowel. Please listen carefully to the following recording:

You education majors might be especially interested in it because it offers the opportunity to do some teaching -- that is, tutoring in math and English. (Sentence 4 in Passage 1)

In this example, there is a phenomenon called "liaison" occurring between "it offers," where /t/ is sandwiched between two vowels. Similarly, in "that is," the /t/ also undergoes the same change. The voiced /t̬/ is very close to /d/ because they share the same tongue placement, and /t̬/ has both the airflow and a slightly lighter vocal cord vibration compared to /d/. However, /t̪/ is relatively shorter and feels more elastic—indeed, directly pronouncing /t̪/ as /d/ is also possible, as the difference is minimal.

Strictly speaking, it goes like this: when the voiceless consonant /t/ is sandwiched between two vowels, with the first vowel being stressed and the second vowel being unstressed, /t/ becomes voiced /t̬/. For example, words like "writer" and "rider," "latter" and "ladder," "petal" and "pedal" sound quite similar. Therefore, the second "t" in "opportunity" and the second "t" in "tutoring" in the previous passage are not voiced.

However, it's challenging to distinguish these cases, especially for Chinese learners who study English as a foreign language. So, first understand the phenomenon of "voicing" and then try your best to imitate it, but there's no need to be overly demanding. In practice, through frequent speaking, even without intentionally voicing, it will naturally occur. Moreover, this is just a minor detail in pronunciation and plays a very small role in achieving effective communication.

In natural speech flow, consonants /t/, /k/, /p/, and /ʧ/ that occur after the stressed syllable with /s/ often undergo voicing. So, "study" is pronounced like /sdʌdɪ/, "school" sounds like /sgu:l/, "experience" becomes /ɪksˈbɪərəns/, and "strive" is pronounced as /sʤaɪv/.

However, sometimes these voiceless consonants (/t/, /k/, /p/, /ʧ/) in front of /s/ do not become voiced when they are not part of a stressed syllable with a following vowel. So in words like "distance," "costume," and "biscuit," the consonants following /s/ remain voiceless. Of course, in the word "coast," the /t/ definitely does not become voiced.
